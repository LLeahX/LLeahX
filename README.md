  <p align="center">I want to take some time to tell how much I appreciate and love ONE OR EIGHT. I'm just a simple 14 year old girl, 8ut I feel like ONE OR EIGHT 8rought more encouragment and support on me more then I could 8ring it on myself. I thought I would never make it to 8ecome a music artist until I heard a8out them. Ever since I listened to their music, I felt more hopeful for myself. I felt as if I could really make music without thinking it's stupid or feeling no motivation to do so. I have been apart of 1DERZ since the 8eggining of ONE OR EIGHT and I really feel as if they have affected me in ways no other group has. Yes I have had many inspirations, 8ut none of them was like ONE OR EIGHT. I have been listening to their music on repeat every single day. I enjoy their interactions and how joyful and positive they are even if it's the smallest 8ecause even the smallest thing a group can do, can bring the 8iggest spark of happiness to a person. ONE OR EIGHT has done that for me and everyday I think of how grateful I am to be scrolling through my recommendation music and hearing them. I would have never felt motivated if it wasn't for ONE OR EIGHT. Everyone will see a small group like theirselves as just regular artist, 8ut to me their music is like a home. Their figures to me are my comfort people more then my own family. I look up to ONE OR EIGHT all the time. I hope they continue with music and continue making people happy and motivated like they have did me. I love you, ONE OR EIGHT.  Thank you Souma, Takeru, Yuga, Tsubasa, Reia, Neo, Mizuki and Ryota for making an impact like this on my life. ❤️</p>
